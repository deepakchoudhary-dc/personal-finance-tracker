# GitHub Upload Steps

## Quick Upload to GitHub (Manual Method)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the green "New" button or go to https://github.com/new
3. Repository name: `personal-finance-tracker`
4. Description: `Real-time Personal Finance & Inflation Impact Tracker with API integration`
5. Set to **Public** (recommended for portfolio)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Copy the Repository URL
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you the repository URL like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/personal-finance-tracker.git
```
Copy this URL.

### Step 3: Connect Local Repository to GitHub
Open PowerShell in VS Code terminal and run these commands one by one:

```powershell
# Navigate to project directory
cd "e:\web summarizer\finance_tracker"

# Add GitHub as remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/personal-finance-tracker.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Verify Upload
1. Go to your GitHub repository page
2. Refresh the page
3. You should see all your files uploaded!
